            <div class="value">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of
                a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
                English.

        <div class="value">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
            been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
            into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
            release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
            software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
